Things to think about:

MSA's:
There are MICROpolitan verus METROpolitan statiscal areas. I THINK we can plot all of them, but can we go for just one, at least for this phase?

FONTS

To Do List:
-Spend a half hour or so on trying to get the KML file converted to polygons that can be used in lieu of the points.
-Rig up the div container that is supposed to appear, and get something basic to show up â€” the name of the Micro/Metropolitan area, for example.
-Fix the Washington BUG
